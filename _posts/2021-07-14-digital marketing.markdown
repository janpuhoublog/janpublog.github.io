Digital marketing, also called online marketing, is not only the promotion of brands to connect with potential customers using the internet and other forms of digital communication, but also achieve short term convertions to generate money.

The goal are (1) find the right influencers and decisions makers of your target company (2) gernerate prospecting with customer lead lists (3) understand user experience and insights of who use the product. 

When you are a member of digital marketing team, you are going to realize quickly not everyone in the company has the same priorities. When we are new comer we incorrectly assume that we must have numerous priorities and multitask to get ahead in business, even though working in this way can deeply affect (and hurt) our productivity. My advice is work on the top priority: make money for the company, not make friend for yourself. 

When we dig down to the root cause of whatever issue fail a digital marketing team, for example burnout or underperformance, pretty much every time the answer comes up as too many priorities. And the person coming up with new priorities on top of the many plates someone is already spinning? Their boss. It is not uncommon that the developer wants more salary, less work and walking distance to office. But the bosses want the customer to be so happy that they will pay a lot of money for our product, and will tell you the want every features into the product and EVERYTHING IS A PRIORITY.

If we can not make everyone happy, just focus on top priority: Increase Sales and/or Revenue. ...Increase Profit. The purpose of our digital marketing team in to bridge the gap between the customers and our product. More importly, retain more paid customers.
